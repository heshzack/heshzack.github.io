                            This project is about creating a business-to-consumer e-commerce 
                            website, which focuses on selling medical equipment to the Malaysian 
                            citizens. The reason leading to the commencement of this project is 
                            to help Malaysians in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
                            main purpose of the website is to provide an online platform which is 
                            user-friendly ― as in easy to navigate through ― for the users to 
                            purchase medical equipment from home, as the equipment such as face 
                            masks and hand sanitisers have become daily-life products during the 
                            pandemic. With the creation of this website, Malaysians can buy the 
                            medical products without having to go to the physical stores and having 
                            the risk of spreading or being infected by the virus, as self-imposed 
                            social isolation is practised in order to avoid contagion and the 
                            stringent confinement measures are put in place.

                            The aim of this project is to create a two-player boat racing game. At 
                            the beginning of the game, each player 
                            will be allocated with a boat. During the game, the players take turn to 
                            throw the dice (you can use the random function to generate the random 
                            dice number) to decide how many steps should the boat move forward. The 
                            river is visualised as 100-columns track, which is filled with random 
                            number of traps(#) and currents(C). Once the game started, all the traps 
                            and currents will be scattered randomly in the river. Some currents are 
                            stronger than the others, so as the traps. The stronger current or trap 
                            will make the boat moves more steps forward or backward. When boat hits 
                            the trap, the boat will need to move backward x number of steps, when the 
                            boat hits the current, it will move forward x number of steps. The boat 
                            should not be allowed to move beyond the river’s boundary. Game will end 
                            when either player’s boat reaches the end of the river. The location of 
                            the boats after every move is displayed.

                            which is the database only deals with customers from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, 
                            and Singapore. Besides that, only online payments methods such as e-wallet, online 
                            banking, and credit card are accepted. This is because the company only does online
                            business. The database only has products from 3 product groups which are beer, 
                            spirits, and alcohol. Lastly, the number of products bought by customers are at least 
                            one carton which is 24 products to cover up the delivery fees.
