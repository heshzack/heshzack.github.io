                <p>
                    I am independent, passionate about programming, building web pages and apps, good at problem-solving, adept 
                    at leading a team and working together in one. I am presently pursuing a degree in software engineering and 
                    doing my utmost to improve my programming and computing skills.<br><br>
                    As I am still yet to complete the course, I currently have intermediate knowledge and experience in various 
                    languages, including Python, Java, Scala, HTML and CSS, XML, Javascript, PHP and SQL. I have also done several 
                    projects using the mentioned languages throughout the course.<br><br>
                    Prior to studying this course, I took a degree in automotive engineering in Germany. However, I had to stop my 
                    degree program there because I had to attend medical appointments in Malaysia. During the pandemic, I decided 
                    to learn the basics of coding just to gain some extra knowledge, because I have always found it fascinating 
                    but never had the time and chance to go into it.<br><br>
                    Since then, I have devoted my time by watching tutorial videos and practicing it during my free time and I 
                    could not stop because I enjoyed it a lot. From that moment, I was certain that software engineering was the 
                    right course to choose. Despite having to start from the beginning again, I was delighted that I had the
                    opportunity to actually enrol in this course perhaps to secure a future in this field.<br><br>
                    Now, I am enthusiastic to learn more and improve my skills, so feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
